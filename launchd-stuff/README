launchdsocket is a thing I made when playing with launchd sockets. A Python function that wraps around launch_activate_socket(3) and returns a list.

check-battery is a script I made that checks and logs the battery levels on macOS, and posts a notification when it's at "100%". The launchd agent runs it every 10 minutes (if you decide to actually use it, edit the paths for your own setup).
